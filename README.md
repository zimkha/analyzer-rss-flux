# First project in python 
  I wanted to make my own rss parser with python
# 
   firstly I have a validatore function which validates the given url (s)
   #
   a get_source function which returns the source code of the url given as a parameter
   #
and the last get_feed function which receives as a parameter a url array and for each url we do the traversing of parsing and returning the data
